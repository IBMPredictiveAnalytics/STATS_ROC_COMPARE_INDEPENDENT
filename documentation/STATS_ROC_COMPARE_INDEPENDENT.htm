<H2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Compare Areas Under Independent ROC Curves</P></H2>

<P>
Gives areas under independent ROC curves for groups defined by a single grouping
variable, along with nonparametric asymptotic standard errors, p values for testing
null hypothesis of .5 values and asymptotic confidence intervals for areas under
curves. Also provides an omnibus test of equality of areas under independent ROC 
curves, as well as pairwise comparisons among each pair of curves, using 
nonparametric standard error estimates. Pairwise comparisons give differences in 
areas under the curves, standard errors, Z statistics, p values and confidence 
intervals for differences in areas. Standard errors are based on Hanley and McNeil
(1982). P values and confidence intervals are not adjusted for multiple comparisons.</P>

<B>Data Requirements and Operations:</B>
</P>

<P>
The test variable must be numeric. The state variable and the grouping variable may
be numeric or string. The positive test value must be a single value.
</P>

<P>
Cases are deleted if they are missing on any named variables (listwise deletion).
</P>

<P>
Split files are not allowed. Splits are turned off.
</P>

<P>
Weights are allowed, but fractional or non-integer values are truncated to integers.
